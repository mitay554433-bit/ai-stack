# EmergION Sovereign Runtime

A separate local-first implementation of:

```text
EmergER → EmergION candidate → RECOIL → WVC → GOV/HUMAN_FINAL → REG → FIELD
```

`EmergOX` is an alias for the live FIELD embodiment. It is not a layer, file, folder, server, or authority.

## What is working

- one native Go runtime using only the standard library,
- no ChatGPT dependency,
- no HTTP server,
- local Gemma reasoning through `llama-cli`,
- one GOV-ready EmergION per unique source,
- one compressed evidence object per unique source,
- one compact hash-chained COSL event stream,
- automatic Dropzone capture and clearing,
- explicit HUMAN_FINAL decisions,
- REG acceptance only after approval,
- deterministic FIELD reconstruction,
- automatic JSON and HTML FIELD projections,
- CPU and FIELD analytics,
- a native embedding API under `pkg/fieldapi`,
- cross-platform native builds.

The Gemma adapter is incorporated. A compatible Gemma GGUF model and `llama-cli` executable are not bundled because the model is large and platform-specific. The runtime automatically searches common local paths and `PATH`; `field doctor` fails closed until both are found.

## Minimal persistence

```text
.field/field.cosl     compact append-only semantic and governance events
.field/o/<sha>.gz     one compressed lossless source object per unique hash
dropzone/             transient intake; cleared after verified capture
outputs/              rebuildable FIELD projections
```

No SOURCE, KIN, EmergER, RECOIL, or WVC stage files are persisted.

## Local Gemma discovery

The runtime first checks `GEMMA_BIN` and `GEMMA_MODEL`, then searches `PATH` and common local model directories. Explicit configuration remains available:

```text
GEMMA_BIN=/path/to/llama-cli
GEMMA_MODEL=/path/to/gemma.gguf
GEMMA_MODEL_DIRS=/additional/model/directories
```

Optional tuning:

```text
GEMMA_THREADS=4
GEMMA_CONTEXT=4096
GEMMA_MAX_TOKENS=768
GEMMA_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=180
GEMMA_EXTRA_ARGS=
```

## Operation

```text
field init
field doctor
field run
```

Files placed in the Dropzone are analyzed by local Gemma, reduced to one EmergION candidate, verified through RECOIL/WVC, persisted at GOV, and removed from the Dropzone. The runtime then waits for HUMAN_FINAL.

```text
field decide E-... APPROVE "reason"
```

Approval creates a GOV receipt and a separate REG acceptance receipt. FIELD projections are refreshed automatically.

## Independence

Termux is only one possible current host. The core does not import or depend on Termux. Native binaries are built for Linux AMD64, Linux ARM64, and Windows AMD64. `pkg/fieldapi` allows a future Android, desktop, or embedded native shell to use the same runtime without a CLI or server.

A truly Termux-free Android deployment still requires a native Android shell and a platform build of the local inference engine. That packaging is not yet completed.
